**No longer procrastination**

Good explanations. You cited lots of relevant references. There were some issues with English/grammar, especially in the first few pages of the paper. Please be careful when you take ideas from other papers. They need to be rewritten in your own words. You submitted this paper late, so originally you had 27/30. I took off 2 for late submission = 25/30.
