## Converting precipitation unit from kg/m2/s to mm/day
Considering 1 kg of rain water spread over 1 square meter of surface, and the rain water is in 1 mm thickness.
    Since M=ρV=ρS*H=1000(kg/m3)*1(m2)*H=1kg
    h=1mm
Thus, kg/m2/s = 1mm/s or  86400 mm/day.

Actually, surface precipitation is from precipating water vapor within an air column. If we integrate it from surface to the top of the atmosphere per unit time, the unit becomes kg/m2/s.
