# About me

This is Yuntao's technical blogs.

2019-Now: Ph.D. student at OSU, USA

The most intersting thing is to accumulate every progress I make.

print(" I like coding, bicycling, drawing and architecture.
I am impressed with weather, climate and astronomy.
It's a far way to be proficient in coding, but step by step!")
